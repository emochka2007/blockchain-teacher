# Review

- **Task 1:** ❌ Incorrect  
  **Answer given:** rational numbers  
  **Correct answer:** rational number and real number  
  **Why:** Should specify both rational and real number types.

- **Task 2:** ✅ Correct  
  **Answer given:** b

- **Task 3:** ✅ Correct  
  **Answer given:** 3 apples, -30 degrees

- **Task 4:** ❌ Incorrect  
  **Answer given:** whole number/ natural number (9)  
  **Correct answer:** whole number, integer, rational, real (since √81 = 9)  
  **Why:** √81 = 9 is a perfect square integer, but natural or whole number should be just “9” not categories; better to list number types including integer and rational explicitly.

- **Task 5:** ❌ Incorrect  
  **Answer given:** 1,1666... repeating  
  **Correct answer:** 1.1666... repeating (or 1.16 repeating), decimal representation is repeating  
  **Why:** Decimal 1.1666... is repeating but formatting should use decimal point, not comma; comma suggests thousands separator in English.
