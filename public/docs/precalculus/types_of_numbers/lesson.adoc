= Pre-Calculus Lesson: Types of Numbers

This lesson explores different types of numbers in a step-by-step, example-driven way.
We'll move from simple counting numbers to more complex forms like irrational and complex numbers, always with real-life connections.

== 1. Natural Numbers (Counting Numbers)

*Example 1: Counting Physical Objects*
Imagine a stack of 7 books. If we count them:

stem:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

We are using *natural numbers*.
These numbers are used for *counting only positive quantities*.

== 2. Whole Numbers (Natural Numbers + Zero)

*Example 2: Counting and "Nothing"*
If a store has 0 apples left, you can still represent this with a number:

stem:[0, 1, 2, 3, \dots]

Zero allows us to show the *absence* of something.

== 3. Integers (Whole Numbers + Negatives)

*Example 3: Elevator Floors*
Imagine an elevator in a hotel that goes from basement levels to rooftop floors:

stem:[\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots]

- Negative floors: basement levels.
- Zero: ground floor.
- Positive floors: above ground.

== 4. Rational Numbers (Fractions and Terminating/Repeating Decimals)

*Example 4: Dividing a Pizza*
If you cut a pizza into 8 slices and take 3, you’ve taken:

stem:[\frac{3}{8}]

Written as a decimal:
stem:[0.375] — a terminating decimal.

*Example 5: Repeating Decimals*
If you take 1 slice out of 3 equal slices:

stem:[\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\ldots]

The **3 repeats forever**.

== 5. Irrational Numbers (Non-Terminating, Non-Repeating Decimals)

*Example 6: Diagonal of a Square*
Take a square with sides of length 1 unit. The diagonal length is:

stem:[\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135\ldots]

It goes on forever *without repeating*.

*Real-Life Connection:* This occurs in construction when measuring non-square lengths.

== 6. Real Numbers

*Example 7: Mixing Rational and Irrational*
Both stem:[2] (rational) and stem:[\pi] (irrational) are *real numbers*.
They can be placed on the same *number line*.

Visualize:
- Draw a horizontal line.
- Mark 0, 1, 2 for rationals.
- Approximate stem:[\pi \approx 3.14] for an irrational.

== 7. Complex Numbers

*Example 8: Electrical Engineering Context*
In AC circuit analysis, voltage can be represented as:

stem:[3 + 4i]

Here:
- 3: the real component (resistance effect).
- 4i: the imaginary component (reactance effect).

The stem:[i] is defined as stem:[\sqrt{-1}].

== 8. Visual Summary — Number System Diagram

*Description for a Diagram (mental image):*
Imagine concentric or nested circles:
- Innermost: *Natural Numbers*
- Then *Whole Numbers*
- Then *Integers*
- Then *Rational Numbers*
- Overlay: *Irrational Numbers* (separate but within Real Numbers)
- Outer ring: *Real Numbers*
- Beyond: *Complex Numbers*

== Wrap-Up

- *Natural Numbers:* Counting positive items.
- *Whole Numbers:* Counting with zero.
- *Integers:* Whole numbers + negatives.
- *Rational:* Fractions, repeating/terminating decimals.
- *Irrational:* Non-repeating, non-terminating decimals.
- *Real Numbers:* All rationals + irrationals.
- *Complex Numbers:* Real + imaginary.

By seeing examples in real life — like elevators, pizzas, construction measurements, and electrical engineering — we can connect abstract concepts to practical applications.
